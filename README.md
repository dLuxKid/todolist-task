# Todo List App with React.js + TypeScript

This is a web and mobile responsive Todo List application implemented using React.js and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features including adding, editing, deleting, and viewing todos.

## Features

- **Add a Todo:** Users can easily add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Edit a Todo:** Existing todos can be edited and updated as needed.
- **Delete a Todo:** Users have the option to remove completed or unnecessary todos.
- **View All Todos:** The app displays a list of all the todos.
- **Pagination:** To manage a large number of todos, the list is paginated for better user experience.
